Testing pygslib 
============

These folder is for storing comparison with gslib. We basically run 
standard gslib code (sometime with extra printout included) and we 
compare this with pygslib results. 

You may find in each folder:
- a gslib parameter file with output
- a pygslib ipython notebook with comparisons 

to run a gslib comand use pipes... 

$echo vmodel.par | ./vmodel
